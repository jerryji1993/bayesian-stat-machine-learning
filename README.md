# Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning at Northwestern Statistics

This page serves as a repository for resources of the 2018-2019 reading group "Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning" at Department of Statistics at Northwestern University. 

We mainly follow the course  materials of ["Bayesian Models for Machine Learning"](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/Fall2018/E6720Fall2018.html) by Prof. John Paisley at Columbia. The past course notes can be accessed [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/BayesianModelsMachineLearning2016.pdf).
